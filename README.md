# FlashCardTkinter
Creates a flashcard game from data in an excel file

This program takes in an excel file that has 2 columns (front and back). Each row represents a different card. The program randomly
displays a card and allows you to flip the card. Once flipped, you can either return the card to the pile or remove it from the pile.
The game ends when all card have been removed from the pile.

The .koi file is written in Stremecoder (http://do.pluricorp.com/) that generated the .py file.
