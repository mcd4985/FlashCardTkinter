# FlashCardTkinter
Creates a flashcard game from data in an excel file

This program takes an excel file with 2 columns labelled Front and Back. The Front column represents the front of the card and the Back
column represents the back of the card. Each row represents a different card. The program randomly selects a card to display and allows
you to flip the card when ready. Once on the back, you can either return the card to the pile or remove the card from the pile. The game
ends when all cards are removed from the pile.

The .koi file is written in Stremecoder (http://do.pluricorp.com/) that generated the .py file.
